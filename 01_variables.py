# ✅ DAY-1: Logic Building Exercises

# Q1. Predict the output
x = 5
y = 2

x = x + y      # step 1
y = x - y      # step 2
x = x - y      # step 3

print("Q1 output:", x, y)

# and the out put is x = 2 and y = 5



# Q2. Predict the output
a = 10
b = 3

a = a * b      # step 1
b = a // b     # step 2
a = a // b     # step 3

print("Q2 output:", a, b)

# and the out put is a = 3 and b = 10






# Q3. Predict the Output
x = 4
y = 6
z = 2

x = x + y      # step 1
y = y + z      # step 2
z = x - y      # step 3
x = z + y      # step 4


print("Q3 output :", x, y, z)

# and the output is x = 10, y = 8, z = 2





# Q4. Predict the Output (slightly harder now)
a = 5
b = 12
c = 3

a = a * 2        # step 1
b = b - a        # step 2
c = c + b        # step 3
a = a + c        # step 4
b = a - c        # step 5

print("Q4 output :", a, b, c)

# and the output is a = 15 , b = 10 and c = 5
