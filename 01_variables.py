# ✅ DAY-1: Logic Building Exercises

# Q1. Predict the output
x = 5
y = 2

x = x + y      # step 1
y = x - y      # step 2
x = x - y      # step 3

print("Q1 output:", x, y)

# and the out put is x = 2 and y = 5



# Q2. Predict the output
a = 10
b = 3

a = a * b      # step 1
b = a // b     # step 2
a = a // b     # step 3

print("Q2 output:", a, b)

# and the out put is a = 3 and b = 10
